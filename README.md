# Argo energy analysis â€“ from 06/03/2020 to 13/03/2020

## Introduction
Argo is a heterogeneous cluster made up of nodes from different architectural family. Our aim is to measure and  understand energy utilisation in the cluster in order to implement energy saving measures. We activated energy recording plugin RAPL in Slurm. The period of measurement was approximately a week starting from 06/03/2020 to 13/03/2020.After configuring the monitoring tool, we restarted nodes and this gave us an additional variable `SlurmdStartTime` to measure the time when the energy  started being recorded.

Command used to get the `scontrol show node  -o `

### Node states
The results from the command shows that we have 151 nodes and not all of them were recording enegery. Below is a brief summary of the nodes: 
* We have 2 nodes(nehalem[01-02]) that were not collecting data.
* We  also have additional 2 nodes westmere01 and serial02 that also were not  making any recording. In addition to this I also noticed that NodeHostName was a number and different from the registered name I am not sure if this is the issue and Node `westmere01` had `23938` and `serial02` had `31955`
* Apart from the 4 nodes  mentioned above all other nodes recorded normal readings. Nodes in table 1.0  had  an additional `Reason Attribute` from the rest of the nodes in the cluster at the time of data extraction from Slurm but I captured their energy statistics.

| Node Name        | State         | Reasons  |
| -------------    |:-------------:| --------:|
| Node103          | IDLE+DRAIN    | Node crashes frequently |
| Node93           | IDLE+DRAIN    |  openib RETRY EXCEEDED ERROR |
| Node109          | IDLE+DRAIN     |  batch job complete failure |
| Node132          | IDLE+DRAIN     |    HD problems |
| Node133          | IDLE+DRAIN      |    Low RealMemory |
| Node134          | IDLE+DRAIN      |    Error |
| Serial02         | DOWN+POWER      |    ResumeTimeout reached |
| Westmere01       | IDLE+DRAIN+POWER   |    Low RealMemory |

### Energy reading per partition 
The table 1.1 shows the consumed Megajoules(Mj) and the lowest Kilojoules (kj) per partition. It can be noted that CMSP partition uses almost half of the energy followed by the long partition and GPU partition having the lowest energy. In addition to that GPU nodes have high Lowestkilojoules considering that they are just 2 nodes which is expected.

## Rest of Partitions
All other partitoions serial, test, esp have one type of architecture that they are using, so they is no need to show how energy was being distributed.


## Analysis

* We can imlementat it using the following:
     * We can use architecture family to see which one uses most energy 
     * We can use partitions to see which one uses most of the energy
